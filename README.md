# Various Kitsu CSS Tweaks
These will address various issues that individual users may experience but in which a fix might have unintended side-effects in other areas, so I'm not going to add them to the official repo.

## Install
First install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). Then click on the title of whichever tweak you want to add.

## [Remove Kitsu Feed](https://github.com/Reinachan/remove-kitsu-feed/raw/main/remove-kitsu-feed.user.css)
Removes Kitsu's feed and notifications for users that want to only use it for listing purposes or need a break from social. Also has options for easily enabling or disabling specific parts <br>

## [Remove Horizontal Scroll](https://github.com/Reinachan/Kitsu-CSS-Tweaks/raw/main/remove-horizontal-scroll-kitsu.user.css)
Hides anything that overflows the page on the horizontal axis preventing horizontal scroll on certain window sizes. This might potentially mean that some actual content might slightly disappear, however. It probably won't but it could.
